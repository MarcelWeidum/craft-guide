All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).


## 1.2.0 - 2018-03-09
### Added
- Added the ability to add, edit, and delete User Guides in the Guide CP Section
  - Existing template-based guides can continue to be edited via Twig templates, or can be "converted" over to a User Guideâ€”stored in the database
  - Guides in the CP section can be created using Twig or Markdown
- Added a new Welcome Widget
  - Unlike the Guide Widgets that are created for individual users, this widget can be set in one place and updated across all users who have this widget installed
  - To edit Welcome Widget's content, use the "Guide > Welcome Widget" tab in the global sidebar
- Added an Admin's Log widget
  - Create a changelog for your clients and collaborators
  - Manage the log in the "Guide > Admin's Log" tab in the global sidebar
  - Logs are shown with the newest first and users can choose how many log entries they would like to see on their dashboard

### Changed
- `updateGuideCpNav` now only sets the Guide CP Section subnav when no navigation has been created
  - Going forward, use `updateGuideCpNav` in your Guide CP templates to set the initial subnav links, then edit the subnav in Guide plugin settings
  - This was changed to help facilitate the ability to manage the subnav in plugin settings, as well as to help reduce unneeded re-setting of the subnav on every page load
